                <p className="mb-12">When flying drones in Sweden, it is important to follow the applicable aviation regulations and be aware of where it is allowed to fly. Drone pilots must adhere to specific laws and regulations depending on the droneâ€™s use and flight area. To fly near airports, special permission from air traffic control is often required. There are also restricted areas where flying is prohibited,  such as over prisons and nuclear power plants. To ensure safe and legal flying, use LFV's drone map and check the Swedish Transport Agency's regulations for drone flights
